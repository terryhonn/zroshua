# Zroshua

Smart irrigation controller for Home Assistant: zones on top of your existing
`switch`/`valve` entities, watering groups with controlled concurrency, a scheduler,
weather adjustments, rain & soil sensors, fault control, statistics and notifications.

## Add-on options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `log_level` | Backend log level (`trace`…`error`). |
| `database.driver` | `sqlite` (default, stored in `/data`, covered by HA backups), `mariadb` or `postgres`. |
| `database.host/port/name/username/password` | Connection details for an external database. For the official MariaDB add-on use host `core-mariadb`. |
| `telegram_bot_token` | Bot token from @BotFather. Chat IDs and event filters are configured in the UI (Settings → Notifications). |
| `mqtt_host/mqtt_port/mqtt_username/mqtt_password` | Optional. Only needed for an **external** MQTT broker; with the Mosquitto add-on credentials are auto-detected. Required for the Lovelace cards and native entities. |

**MQTT status:** the Settings page shows whether the MQTT bridge is connected. If the
Lovelace card shows "Waiting for sensor.zroshua_state", MQTT is not connected — install the
Mosquitto add-on + MQTT integration, or set `mqtt_host` in the options.

Changing options restarts the add-on. All irrigation configuration lives in the web UI
and applies instantly without restarts.

## Concepts

- **Zone** — one irrigation line: one or more HA entities switched together, a default
  duration, an optional flow rate (exact l/min or a min–max range), a max-runtime failsafe,
  optional cycle & soak, per-zone ignore flags (rain sensor / weather), a pause control.
- **Water source** *(optional)* — declares hydraulics: max flow budget (l/min), a pump
  entity with start/stop delays (the pump is reference-counted across zones), a dependency
  on another source (a barrel refilled by the well is blocked while well zones run),
  a "water available" binary sensor, an energy meter and an optional flow sensor with an
  idle-flow leak alert.
  - **Exclusivity**: sources marked *never run at the same time* make every pair of groups
    drawing from them mutually exclusive — the scheduler, the timeline conflict check and
    the time-slot picker treat it like a never-overlap rule without one being written.
  - **Volume tracking**: a capacity (liters) turns the source into a tracked barrel — the
    level is estimated from running zones' flow rates minus a constant refill rate, or read
    from an **analog level sensor (%)**. Shown on the dashboard, published as
    `sensor.<source>_level`, warns below the low-reserve threshold and can **block
    scheduled starts** below a critical percentage (manual runs are never blocked).
  - **Flow deviation**: with a flow sensor, the measured flow is compared to the expected
    sum of running zones; a deviation beyond the threshold sustained for 2 minutes raises a
    fault that names the direction (higher → possible burst pipe, lower → clogged emitters
    or low pressure), at most once an hour. Zones without a known flow rate disable the
    check while they run.
  - **Pump after a run**: when the last zone of the source finishes, the pump can be turned
    off (default), left on, or restored to the state it had before Zroshua turned it on
    (only switched off if it was off to begin with). Use *leave on* / *restore* when the pump
    also feeds the house or water outlets. The pump is also treated as a controller: if it is
    `unavailable` at start it raises a fault notification and the run continues best-effort
    (the pre-start availability check already flags it ahead of a scheduled start).
- **Group** — an ordered set of zones with schedules. Execution mode: sequential,
  parallel, or parallel with a limit; inter-zone delay; a 0–200 % duration multiplier;
  priority for queue conflicts.
- **Rules between groups** — *never overlap* (mutex), *order* (A must finish before B
  starts — e.g. well before barrel), *may run in parallel* (drip lines).
- **Queue** — anything that cannot start yet is visible in the dashboard queue with the
  exact reason it is waiting (mutex, flow budget, sequential group busy, soak…).

## Scheduler

- Whole-week template or individual per-day start times; several start times per day;
  seasonal window (`MM-DD`…`MM-DD`).
- Every start time is a **start at** or a **finish by** anchor. With *finish by*, the start
  is computed from the worst-case run length (temperature boost, group batching and
  max-runtime clamps included), so the run is done by the configured time even on the
  hottest planned day.
- **Zone selection per schedule**: each schedule can water only a subset of the group's
  zones (a midday refresh for the two thirstiest beds); unticked zones keep their durations
  for the other schedules.
- Durations = zone default × group multiplier × weather percentage, clamped by the zone's
  min (rollover) and max-runtime limits. Runs shorter than the minimum are skipped and the
  minutes are added to the next run.
- The 7-day forecast of upcoming runs shows both the planned and the worst-case
  (max temperature boost) durations, and **predicts skips**: a run that would be skipped
  under the current state (pause, rain dry-out window with its end time, forecast/weather
  triggers, temperature skip steps) is marked *will skip* with the reasons; conditions that
  depend on start-time data are marked *may skip*.
- Manual runs: one tap, preset duration adjustable with a slider before or during the run,
  guaranteed auto-off. Manual always starts — rain/weather are ignored, hydraulic
  violations only warn.
- **Zone-level schedules**: a zone can carry its own schedules in addition to its group —
  useful when one bed needs watering more often. Such runs are single-zone but still obey
  the group's rules, flow budgets, rain/soil sensors and weather scaling.
- Per-schedule zone duration overrides: each schedule can override zone durations
  (defaults come from the zone); the editor previews the end time of every start,
  including the worst-case temperature boost.
- **Run conditions**: a schedule (group or zone) can require e.g. forecast max
  ≥ 30 °C, rain probability ≤ 40 %, or a live sensor value at start time. A sensor
  condition can read **several sensors combined** (average / min / max) — the one-tap
  **Soil moisture** preset adds a *sensor(s) ≤ %* rule. For each condition you pick what
  happens when it is **not** met: **skip the run**, or **water less** — run at a chosen % of
  the normal time. "Water less" only shortens the run, so it stays inside the reserved
  worst-case slot and never clashes with other groups. Skipping (or trimming) is safe: a
  **soil-moisture trigger** still waters the zone if it dries out before the next scheduled
  run. Failures are journaled; missing data is ignored (never blocks watering).
- **Upcoming waterings** (dashboard and card) list group runs **and** a zone's own
  schedules, each with a skip prediction. Every row has a pause menu — *skip this run*
  (pauses the group or zone only until that run is past), pause 6/12/24 h, or resume.

## Timeline

The Timeline page renders each day (up to 7 ahead) as a 24-hour strip per group: bar
length includes the worst-case temperature boost, so gaps are guaranteed free water time.
Runs that overlap against a never-overlap/order rule are red; resolve them by moving
start times, or set the conflict policy (Settings) to decide what happens at runtime:
**wait** (start when the other group finishes — default) or **skip** (strict timetable,
the run is skipped with a journal reason).

## Weather

- Location and forecast come from the Home Assistant weather entity (auto-detected,
  overridable in Settings).
- Rain skip: probability ≥ X % **and** forecast amount ≥ Y mm.
- Freeze protect below a configurable temperature.
- **Temperature unit** (Settings, next to Language): Celsius or Fahrenheit for all
  temperature displays and inputs. Values are stored as °C; HA °F sensors/forecasts
  are converted before comparison.
- **Volume unit** (Settings, same card): liters or US gallons for water totals, flow
  rates, barrel capacity and MQTT water sensors. Storage and engine math stay in
  liters / L/min; HA flow sensors that report gal/min (GPM) are normalized before
  comparison.
- **Temperature scaling** in percent steps (e.g. below 20 °C → skip, below 25 °C → −30 %,
  above 30 °C → +30 %) driven by the forecast max, yesterday's local sensor max, or a
  combination (max / average). Schedule planning reserves the worst-case boost so extended
  runs can never violate group rules.
- **Auto-allow gate** (per zone) — sticky switch that blocks only automatic runs when off
  (schedules, soil, heat). Manual *Water now* still works. Exposed to Home Assistant as
  `switch.<zone>_auto_allow` over MQTT so automations can disable a zone after measured
  rain without a timed pause. Optional extra HA entity on the zone must also be ON when set.
- **Pause** at three levels — global (all watering), per group and per zone — for a chosen
  number of hours, with automatic resume. A pause skips only automatic runs (schedules, soil
  and weather triggers); manual runs always work. Use a group/zone pause to skip the next run
  without disabling it.

## Sensors

- **Rain** — one or more binary sensors (leak sensors work great): quorum aggregation,
  a configurable dry-out delay after the last wet signal, skip-at-start and stop-during-run
  behaviour (all zones or linked zones only). Zones can ignore the rain sensor individually.
- **Soil moisture** — triggers per zone or group: water for N minutes when moisture drops
  below a threshold, then wait a cooldown (soil sensors react slowly); optionally block
  scheduled runs above a wet threshold; stale sensor data is ignored safely. A trigger can be
  set to **ignore the rain sensor** (greenhouse / covered soil): it fires and keeps watering
  even while rain is detected; by default a wet rain sensor postpones the trigger until dry.
- **Temperature (heat burst)** — when a temperature sensor is at or above a threshold inside
  a daily time window (e.g. ≥ 30 °C between 13:00 and 16:00), water a zone or group for a
  fixed number of minutes, then hold a cooldown. Respects the rain sensor unless the trigger
  is set to ignore it. Replaces the "midday cooling schedule + sensor condition" pattern
  with one setting.

## Fault control

- Check-back after every command: a zone that fails to turn **on** is skipped (the rest of
  the plan continues) and reported. A zone that fails to turn **off** triggers escalation:
  pump shutdown, repeated retries and a critical notification.
- Independent per-zone max-runtime failsafe.
- Zones switched on outside Zroshua are either adopted as manual runs (with auto-off) or
  switched off, per your policy.
- On startup, persisted active runs are resumed and any orphaned "on" zones are reconciled off.
- Optional idle-flow leak detection per source (flow while nothing should be running).

## Statistics

- Calculated liters per run from zone flow rates (ranges produce min–max estimates),
  aggregated per day / zone / group.
- Pump energy is measured **only during runs** (kWh counters or W power sensors both work),
  plus an optional configurable "refill tail" after selected groups, tracked as a separate
  category. Set a tariff to see costs.
- Charts for liters, minutes and kWh per day; CSV export.

## Site map

Upload an SVG plan of your property from any editor (Inkscape, Figma, Illustrator) using any
shapes — rect, path, polygon, circle, ellipse, line. Shapes need no ids; Zroshua injects
stable ids on upload, so a plain export works. In *Assign zones* mode pick a zone, then tap
the shapes that make it up — **a zone can be several shapes**; tapping a shape owned by
another zone moves it. Shapes are **filled by watering type** (sprinkler / drip / beds / lawn
/ shrubs) and **live state is shown by brightness/animation**: watering brightens and pulses
(with remaining minutes on it), idle is steady, queued shows a moving dashed outline, fault
turns red, disabled fades. Tapping a zone opens a popup with status, next run and a water-now
slider. Large plans can be **zoomed and panned** — corner buttons and drag on desktop, pinch-to-zoom
and one-finger drag on mobile. The SVG is stored in the database and is part of config
export/import.

## Notifications

Providers are configured in Settings → Notifications:

- **Telegram** — set `telegram_bot_token` in the add-on options, then add a provider with
  your chat ID(s).
- **Home Assistant notify** — any `notify.*` service, including mobile push.

Events (each provider can subscribe selectively): watering started, watering finished
(duration + time until the next run), skipped (with reason), stopped by rain, faults,
system events.

- **Group-level messages** (default on): a group run sends one *started* message (zones
  planned) and one *finished* message (zones, minutes, liters, next run) instead of a
  message per zone. Rain stops and faults stay per-zone; standalone zone runs are
  unaffected.
- **Daily digest**: one message at a chosen time with the day's totals — runs, minutes,
  liters, energy (and cost with a tariff), skips and faults.
- **Quiet hours**: inside the window (may wrap past midnight) everything except **faults**
  is suppressed.

## Lovelace cards

A custom card (`custom:zroshua-card`) with five views — `dashboard`, `groups`, `zones`,
`upcoming`, `timeline` — lets you run groups/zones, watch the current watering, the queue,
upcoming runs and today's timeline straight from a Home Assistant dashboard. With the
Mosquitto add-on installed the add-on deploys the card to `/config/www` and registers the
Lovelace resource automatically (YAML-mode dashboards: add `/local/zroshua-card.js` as a
module resource yourself). Add it to a view with `type: custom:zroshua-card`, `view: groups`.
The card reads `sensor.zroshua_state` and sends commands via the `mqtt.publish` service.

## MQTT discovery (native HA entities)

Zero-configuration: if the **Mosquitto broker** add-on is installed, the Supervisor hands
Zroshua the credentials automatically and the following entities appear in Home Assistant
(via MQTT discovery, grouped under a "Zroshua" device):

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `switch.<zone>_watering` per zone | Turn on = manual run with the zone default duration (auto-off timer); turn off = stop. Usable in automations and by voice assistants. |
| `sensor.<zone>_next_watering` per zone | Timestamp of the next scheduled run. |
| `binary_sensor.zroshua_watering_active` | Whether anything is watering. |
| `sensor.zroshua_water_today` / `sensor.zroshua_pump_energy_today` | Daily consumption totals. |
| `sensor.<source>_water_today` per water source | Daily liters attributed to that source (a run is attributed via its zone's source; zones without a source count only toward the total). |
| `sensor.<source>_level` per capacity-tracked source | Estimated (or sensor-measured) fill level of a barrel-type source, in %. |
| `switch.zroshua_snooze` | Pause all automatic watering for 24 h (turn off to resume). |

The consumption sensors carry `device_class` (`water` / `energy`) and
`state_class: total_increasing` (the midnight reset to 0 reads as a meter reset), so
Home Assistant records **long-term statistics** for them and they can be added to the
**Energy dashboard** (water source / individual device).

Availability is handled with a Last-Will message: if the add-on dies, entities show
*unavailable* instead of stale states. Without a broker the bridge stays dormant.

### Consumption charts

With statistics recorded, the built-in `statistics-graph` card charts water per hour,
day or week — no extra custom cards:

```yaml
type: statistics-graph
title: Water per hour
chart_type: bar
period: hour
days_to_show: 1
stat_types: [change]
entities:
  - sensor.zroshua_water_today   # or the per-source sensors to compare sources
```

Use `period: day` + `days_to_show: 7` for a week-by-day view, or `period: week` for
weekly totals. Statistics accumulate from the first start of add-on version 0.1.16 —
earlier history is not backfilled.

## Backup & restore

- With the default SQLite driver everything (including the site map) lives in `/data`
  and is included in Home Assistant backups.
- With MariaDB/PostgreSQL, data lives in your database server.
- Settings → Backup: export/import the whole configuration as JSON at any time.
