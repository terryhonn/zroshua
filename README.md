# Zroshua 💧

**Smart irrigation for Home Assistant** — a native add-on with a full web UI in the sidebar.
Zones on top of your existing `switch`/`valve` entities, watering groups with controlled
concurrency, a conflict-aware scheduler, weather intelligence, rain & soil sensors,
stuck-valve protection, water & energy statistics, a live site map and Telegram notifications.
The interface follows your Home Assistant language automatically — English, Українська,
Polski, Deutsch, Slovenčina, Română, Italiano, Español, Čeština, Français (English fallback).

## Why an add-on (not an integration)?

- **Sidebar panel** via ingress — a mobile/tablet-friendly SPA, no custom Lovelace cards, no YAML.
- **Own process** with a Supervisor watchdog: the scheduler runs independently of the HA event
  loop and survives HA restarts (active runs are persisted and resumed).
- **Own database** for run history, skip reasons and consumption statistics.
- Controls any hardware through HA entities: ESPHome, Zigbee, Shelly, anything that is a
  `switch` or `valve`.

## Installation

One click — add this repository to your Home Assistant add-on store:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with this repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRobinCK%2Fzroshua)

Then find **Zroshua** in the store and click **Install**. Or add it manually:

1. In Home Assistant open **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**.
2. Menu (⋮) → **Repositories** → add:

   ```
   https://github.com/RobinCK/zroshua
   ```

3. Find **Zroshua** in the store and click **Install** (the image is built locally on first
   install — this takes a few minutes).
4. Start the add-on — **Zroshua** appears in the sidebar.

### Add-on options

All irrigation configuration lives in the web UI and applies instantly. The add-on options
hold only system-level settings:

```yaml
log_level: info          # trace | debug | info | warning | error
database:
  driver: sqlite         # sqlite (default) | mariadb | postgres
  # host: core-mariadb   # for external databases
  # port: 3306
  # name: zroshua
  # username: zroshua
  # password: "..."
telegram_bot_token: ""   # optional, from @BotFather
```

- **sqlite** (default): everything lives in `/data`, which is included in Home Assistant
  backups — zero configuration, restore together with the rest of your system.
- **mariadb / postgres**: keep the data in an external database (use host `core-mariadb`
  for the official MariaDB add-on).
- With the **Mosquitto** add-on installed, MQTT credentials are picked up automatically
  from the Supervisor — no configuration needed.

## Tour

### Dashboard

![Dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

Live overview: what is watering right now (with progress, `+5 min` and stop buttons), the
**queue with the exact reason** each run is waiting (`sequential group busy`, `mutex with
group X`, `flow budget exceeded`…), info tiles (zones, groups, today's water and time),
weather with a 7-day forecast, countdowns to upcoming waterings and quick actions
(stop all / pause all watering for a set number of hours). Tapping a running or queued
zone opens its action sheet (stop, water for a preset, pause).

Upcoming waterings are **predicted, not just listed**: a run that would be skipped under
the current state carries a red *will skip* badge with the reason — e.g.
`rain dry-out until 09:17` while the sensor is already dry but the dry-out delay is still
counting — and a yellow *may skip* badge when it depends on data known only at start time
(forecast, live sensor conditions). The list includes **a zone's own schedules** (tagged
*zone*), not only group runs. Each row has a **pause menu**: *skip this run* (pauses just
that group or zone until the run is past), pause 6/12/24 h, or resume — so you can drop one
upcoming watering straight from the dashboard. Barrel-type water sources show a **live level
bar** (estimated or from a level sensor) right in the quick-actions card.

![Skip or pause an upcoming run from the dashboard](docs/screenshots/upcoming-pause.png)

### Timeline

Each day as a 24-hour strip per group — see exactly when water is busy and when it is free.
Zones are drawn at their planned (unscaled) times — temperature scaling shifts every following
zone of the group, so bars never overlap. Each run then shows its **finish window** as a
translucent tail: medium = may finish earlier (negative scaling), faint = the worst-case
temperature boost. Gaps after the faint tail are guaranteed free time. Runs that violate a
*never-overlap / order* rule are highlighted red with an alert (checked against the worst case).

![Timeline](docs/screenshots/timeline.png)

### Groups, schedules and the time-slot picker

A group is an ordered set of zones with schedules and an execution mode: **sequential**
(one zone at a time), **parallel** (all together) or **parallel with a limit**. Add an
inter-zone delay for pressure recovery, a 0–200 % duration multiplier and a priority.

Schedules support a whole-week template or **per-day start times**, several waterings per
day, a seasonal window (`MM-DD`…`MM-DD`), **per-schedule zone durations** (defaults come
from the zone), a **zone selection** (tick which of the group's zones this start waters —
so the midday refresh can hit only the two thirsty beds while the evening run does the
whole group) and **run conditions**.

Every start time is either a *start at* or a **finish by** anchor: pick *finish by* and
Zroshua computes the start from the worst-case run length (temperature boost included), so
"lawn done before the 07:00 school run" stays true even on +20 % days.

Start times are picked on a 24-hour occupancy strip: **red bands** are schedules of groups
bound to this one by rules (worst-case length included), gray bands are other schedules,
teal is this run — drawn solid for the planned length with a **hatched worst-case tail**,
so you see exactly how far a hot day can stretch it. The picker shows *free until HH:MM*
and warns live when the chosen slot overlaps a rule-bound group; saving with a conflict
shows a loud warning.

![Group editor](docs/screenshots/group-editor.png)
![Time slot picker](docs/screenshots/time-picker.png)

**Rules between groups** encode your hydraulics declaratively:

| Rule | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Never overlap | The groups may never run at the same time. |
| Order (A before B) | B waits until A has finished (e.g. well always before barrel). |
| May run in parallel | Explicitly allowed to overlap (drip lines). |

Rules cover what hydraulics can't express — most exclusivity you don't have to write at
all: mark two **water sources** as *never run at the same time* and every pair of groups
drawing from them is mutually exclusive automatically (see below).

What happens when a scheduled run still collides at runtime is your choice
(**Settings → conflict policy**): *wait in queue* (default) or *skip the run* for a strict
timetable — always with a journal reason.

### Run conditions

Every schedule (group or zone) can carry criteria checked at start time — all must pass:

- **Forecast max temperature today** ≥ / ≤ X °C (e.g. run the midday cooling cycle only in heat),
- **Forecast rain probability** ≥ / ≤ X %,
- **Sensor value(s)** at start time — one sensor, or **several combined** (average / min /
  max). The one-tap **Soil moisture** preset drops in a *sensor(s) ≤ %* condition.

For each condition you choose what happens when it is **not** met: **skip the run**, or
**water less** — run at a chosen % of the normal time instead of skipping. "Water less" only
*shortens* the run, so it always fits inside the reserved worst-case slot and never clashes
with another group. So the Soil-moisture preset can either skip when the bed is already moist,
or just trim the run. Either way it's safe — a **soil-moisture trigger** still waters the zone
if it dries out before the next scheduled run.

Failures are journaled and notified; **unavailable data never blocks watering** — a dead
sensor won't leave the garden dry.

![Run conditions with a multi-sensor soil-moisture skip](docs/screenshots/schedule-conditions.png)

### Zones

A zone = one irrigation line: one or more HA entities switched together, a default duration
(the preset for manual runs), an optional **flow rate** (exact l/min or a min–max range) used
for statistics and flow budgets, a **max-runtime failsafe**, optional cycle & soak, per-zone
ignore flags (rain sensor / weather) and — when one bed needs more water than
its group — **own schedules** in addition to the group's.

![Zones](docs/screenshots/zones.png)

**Manual runs always start**: they ignore the rain sensor, weather and any pause; hydraulic
conflicts produce a warning, not a block. Every manual run is a timer — the zone always
switches off by itself (with the max-runtime failsafe as a second, independent layer).

**Pause** (skip without disabling): every zone and every group has a pause control — pause
its automatic runs for a chosen number of hours (3 / 6 / 12 / 24 / 48) and it resumes by
itself, or resume it manually. There is also a global *Pause all watering* on the dashboard.
A pause only skips **automatic** watering (schedules, soil and weather triggers); manual runs
still work. Use it to skip today's run for one bed or group without turning it off.

### Water sources

Sources make hydraulics first-class: a **max flow budget** (l/min — the scheduler never lets
concurrently running zones exceed it), a **pump entity** kept on while any zone of the source
runs (reference-counted, with start/stop delays), a **dependency** on another source
("blocked while that source runs"), a *water available* sensor, an optional flow sensor with
an idle-flow leak alert, an **energy meter** and a configurable **refill tail** (count pump
energy for N minutes after selected groups finish — e.g. while the barrel refills).

**Pump after a run**: choose what happens when the last zone finishes — *turn the pump off*
(default), *leave it on*, or *restore the state it had before* (only switch off if it was
off before Zroshua started it). Use *leave on* / *restore* when the pump also feeds the house
or water outlets and must not be cut. The pump doubles as a **controller availability check**:
if it is `unavailable` at start (or within the pre-start window), you get a fault
notification and the run continues best-effort.

![Water source: pump behaviour after a run](docs/screenshots/sources-pump.png)

**Source exclusivity**: mark sources that must *never run at the same time* (a well pump and
a barrel pump on one power line, or a barrel refilled by the well) and the mutual exclusion
propagates to every pair of groups using them — the scheduler, the timeline conflict check
and the time-slot picker all treat it like a never-overlap rule, without writing one per
group pair.

**Volume tracking for barrels**: give a source a capacity (liters) and Zroshua keeps a live
level estimate — consumption from the flow rates of running zones, refill from a constant
refill rate — or reads an **analog level sensor (%)** directly when you have one. The level
shows on the dashboard, is published to HA as `sensor.<source>_level`, warns below a
**low-reserve** threshold and can optionally **block scheduled starts** below a critical
percentage (manual runs still work).

**Flow deviation alert**: with a flow sensor on the source, the measured flow is compared to
the sum of the running zones' expected rates; a sustained deviation beyond your threshold
raises a fault naming the direction — higher (possible burst pipe) or lower (clogged
emitters / low pressure).

### Sensors

- **Rain** — one or several `binary_sensor`s (leak sensors work great): quorum aggregation
  ("N of M must be wet"), a **dry-out delay** after the last wet signal, skip-at-start and
  stop-during-run behaviour. Zones can ignore the rain sensor individually.
- **Soil moisture** — per zone or group: water for N minutes when moisture drops below a
  threshold, then wait a **cooldown** (soil sensors react slowly); optionally block scheduled
  runs above a wet threshold; stale data is ignored safely. Each trigger can **ignore the rain
  sensor** — soil under a roof or in a greenhouse gets watered even while it rains outside.
- **Temperature (heat burst)** — give a lawn a short extra shower on hot afternoons: when a
  temperature sensor passes a threshold **inside a time window** (e.g. ≥ 30 °C between 13:00
  and 16:00), run a zone or group for N minutes, then hold a cooldown. Respects the rain
  sensor unless told to ignore it.

![Sensors](docs/screenshots/sensors.png)

### Site map

Draw your property as an SVG in any editor (Inkscape, Figma, Illustrator) using **any shapes**
— rectangles, paths, polygons, circles — and upload it. Shapes don't need ids; Zroshua adds
them automatically, so a plain Figma export works. In *Assign zones* mode you pick a zone and
tap the shapes that make it up — **a single zone can be several shapes** (a bed drawn as two
rectangles, a lawn split by a path). The map is two-channel: **fill color = watering type**
(sprinkler, drip, beds, lawn, shrubs) so the plan reads like a real garden legend, and **live
state = brightness/animation** — a watering zone brightens and pulses (with its **remaining
minutes** on it), idle is steady, queued shows a moving dashed outline, fault turns red,
disabled fades out. Tapping a zone opens a popup with its status, next run and a water-now
slider. Large plans **zoom and pan** — zoom buttons in the corner and drag to pan on desktop,
**pinch-to-zoom and one-finger drag** on mobile.

![Site map](docs/screenshots/map.png)

In *Assign zones* mode you pick a zone and paint the shapes that belong to it (green = this
zone, purple = another zone, gray = free):

![Assign zones on the map](docs/screenshots/map-assign.png)

### Statistics

Calculated liters per run (flow rate × actual duration; ranges give min–max estimates),
minutes and **pump energy measured only while watering** (kWh counters and W power sensors
both work) plus the refill-tail category. Set a tariff and currency to see costs. Daily
charts and CSV export.

![Statistics](docs/screenshots/stats.png)

### Journal

Every decision is explainable: run started/finished (duration), **every skip with its
reason** (rain sensor wet, forecast, condition failed, below-minimum rollover, conflict
policy…), temperature adjustments, faults, reconciliations. Filter by **event type** and by
**zone or group** (the picker groups the two and each row is tagged so you always know which
is which). On a phone the log renders as stacked cards instead of a wide table.

Group and zone cards also show **when each was last actually watered** — a skipped run is not
counted, so "last watered" reflects real watering, not the schedule. For a group it is the last
time the *group* ran: watering one of its zones by hand, or by that zone's own schedule or soil
trigger, updates the zone but leaves the group as it was.

![Journal](docs/screenshots/journal.png)

### Settings

![Settings](docs/screenshots/settings.png)

- **Weather triggers**: skip the day when rain probability ≥ X % *and* forecast amount ≥ Y mm;
  freeze protect below a threshold. Location and forecast come from your HA weather entity.
- **Temperature scaling** in percent steps (e.g. below 20 °C → skip; below 25 °C → −10 %;
  above 30 °C → +20 %), driven by the forecast max, **yesterday's max from your own sensor**,
  or a combination. Planning always reserves the worst-case boost, so boosted runs can never
  break group rules.
- **Conflict policy**: wait in queue vs. skip (strict timetable).
- **Pre-start availability check**: if a zone's entity or its source pump is `unavailable`
  within a configurable window (default 30 min) before a scheduled start, you get a fault
  notification naming the exact entity.
- **Notifications**: Telegram (several chat IDs) and/or any HA `notify.*` service, each with
  its own event filter — started, finished (duration + time to next run), skipped (with
  reason), stopped by rain, faults, system. **Group-level mode** collapses a sequential run
  of 13 beds into two messages (started / finished with totals) instead of 26; a **daily
  digest** at a chosen time sums up runs, liters, energy, cost and skips (sent to every
  provider; not blocked by quiet hours or event filters — Settings has a **Send test
  digest** button, plus **Test notify** on each HA provider); **quiet hours**
  hold everything except faults and the digest during the night.
- **External switch policy**: a zone turned on outside Zroshua is either adopted as a manual
  run (auto-off) or switched back off.
- **Backup**: export/import the whole configuration as JSON.

### Mobile

The UI is mobile-first — this is how the dashboard looks in the HA companion app:

<img src="docs/screenshots/mobile-dashboard.png" width="320" alt="Mobile dashboard" />

## Reliability guarantees

- **Check-back on every switch**: a zone that fails to turn on is skipped (the rest of the
  plan continues); a zone that fails to turn **off** triggers escalation — source pump
  shutdown, repeated retries, critical notification.
- Independent **max-runtime failsafe** per zone.
- **Restart-safe**: active runs are persisted and resumed; on startup any zone found "on"
  without a matching run is reconciled off.
- Optional **idle-flow leak detection** per source (water flowing while nothing runs).

## Lovelace cards

For controlling irrigation straight from a Home Assistant dashboard — without opening the
add-on — Zroshua ships a custom Lovelace card with five views. When the Mosquitto add-on is
present the card works with **zero setup**: the add-on copies `zroshua-card.js` into
`/config/www` and registers it as a dashboard resource automatically (on YAML-mode
dashboards, add the resource `/local/zroshua-card.js` as a *module* manually).

Add a card to any view:

```yaml
type: custom:zroshua-card
view: dashboard   # dashboard | groups | zones | upcoming | timeline
title: Irrigation # optional
```

| View | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `dashboard` | Tiles (watering now / queued / water today / next), live runs with progress + stop, the queue with reasons, tap a run/queued zone for its action sheet, and stop-all / pause-all buttons. |
| `groups` | Modern tiles per group: execution mode, "N watering · M queued" while running, countdown to the next start and a full-width **Run / Stop group** button. |
| `zones` | Zones grouped into sections by watering group with **filter chips** (All / Active / Idle / Off); tapping a zone opens an action sheet with duration presets and Stop — built for dozens of zones. |
| `upcoming` | The next scheduled runs with countdowns — runs that will be skipped under the current state (rain dry-out, pause…) are dimmed with a red reason line, uncertain ones get a yellow *may skip*. |
| `timeline` | Today's 24-hour occupancy strip per group (conflicts in red), with the worst-case temperature boost of each run drawn as a hatched tail. |

The card reads a single `sensor.zroshua_state` entity (published over MQTT) and sends actions
back through the `mqtt.publish` service — so it stays live and needs no per-entity wiring.

> **Requires MQTT.** The cards and the native entities below need a broker. Install the
> **Mosquitto broker** add-on and the **MQTT** integration — credentials are then picked up
> automatically. For an external broker, set `mqtt.host` (and port/username/password) in the
> add-on options. The add-on's **Settings** page shows a live MQTT status banner; if it says
> *MQTT off*, the card will display "Waiting for sensor.zroshua_state".

![Card: groups](docs/screenshots/card-groups.png)

![Card: zones](docs/screenshots/card-zones.png)

| `dashboard` | `upcoming` |
|---|---|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/card-dashboard.png" width="390" alt="Card: dashboard" /> | <img src="docs/screenshots/card-upcoming-mobile.png" width="390" alt="Card: upcoming (mobile)" /> |

![Card: timeline](docs/screenshots/card-timeline.png)

Group tiles have a **pause** control (and the zone action sheet a Pause / Resume button) so
you can skip a group or a single zone for a few hours without disabling it. Tapping a zone
opens a floating action sheet over the list — no scrolling even with dozens of zones:

<img src="docs/screenshots/card-zone-sheet.png" width="320" alt="Zone action sheet on mobile" />

## Native HA entities (MQTT discovery)

With the Mosquitto add-on installed, Zroshua automatically publishes a "Zroshua" device:
per-zone watering switches (turn on = manual run with auto-off), next-watering timestamp
sensors, a watering-active binary sensor, daily water/energy sensors **plus a daily water
sensor per water source** (well vs. barrel), a **level sensor (%) per capacity-tracked
source** and a pause-all switch. The consumption sensors
carry `device_class`/`state_class`, so Home Assistant records long-term statistics — the
built-in *statistics-graph* card charts liters per hour / day / week out of the box, and
the sensors fit the Energy dashboard. Availability uses a Last-Will message, so a dead
add-on shows *unavailable* instead of stale states.

## Documentation

- [Add-on documentation](zroshua/DOCS.md) — the detailed feature guide (also shown in the
  add-on's Documentation tab).

## Development

```bash
# backend (NestJS + TypeORM)
cd zroshua/backend && npm install && npm run build && node dist/main.js
# frontend (React + Vite + Mantine) — dev server proxies /api to :8099
cd zroshua/frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

### Releases

A release is a commit that changes `version:` in `zroshua/config.yaml` — that
field is what the Supervisor compares to offer an update, so bump it **last**,
after the change is verified. Add the matching `zroshua/CHANGELOG.md` section in
the same commit, then tag it:

```bash
bash scripts/tag-releases.sh --push
```

The script tags every released version that is not tagged yet, taking the tag
message from that version's changelog section, and is safe to re-run.

### Translations

The UI uses [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/); dictionaries are plain JSON in
`zroshua/frontend/src/locales/`. The key **is** the English source text, so a
missing translation falls back to readable English rather than a blank or a key
name, and `en.json` is the list of source strings.

```bash
cd zroshua/frontend
npm run i18n         # sync the dictionaries with the t() calls in the code
npm run i18n:check   # fail if they are out of date (used in CI)
```

`npm run i18n` adds strings that are new and removes strings that are gone, in
every language at once. To add a language: put its code in `locales` in
`i18next-parser.config.js` and in `SUPPORTED` / `LANG_OPTIONS` in `src/i18n.ts`,
run `npm run i18n`, then fill in the new `<lang>.json`. Untranslated entries are
left as empty strings, so they are easy to find.

Some keys are built at runtime (`t(zone.type)`, `t(weather.condition)`) and
cannot be found by scanning the code — those are declared in
`src/i18n-dynamic.ts`. Plural forms are generated per language from the CLDR
rules, so pass `count`: `t('{count} days ago', { count: 3 })`.

Roadmap: ET/bucket-based suggested durations, volume-based watering, Telegram inline
actions.
